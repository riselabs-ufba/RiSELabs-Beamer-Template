RiSE Beamer Template
========

A template beamer for RiSE Labs presentations.


Requirements
------------

You must have latex installed correctly.


How to use
----------

You can proceed in two different ways, either from scratch or by clone this repository and adjusting the document.tex file to cope with your needs.

To start from scratch, you should proceed in the following way:
1. Start a beamer document by yourself (e.g., main.tex);
2. Copy the template file (beamerthemeRiSE.sty) in the same directory of your main tex file;
3. In the preamble add the the following line "\usetheme{RiSE}" (you can see an example in the document.tex, which can be found in the folder 'src').
